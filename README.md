Welcome to Wake-Tools â€“ Where JIT comes to live ðŸš€

Wake is not just another runtime â€” it's a **next-gen Just-In-Time (JIT) engine** designed for developers who want to build **faster, safer, and bolder**.

This organization hosts the **Wake ecosystem**:
- **Wake Engine** â€“ the live JIT core, written in C99, designed for instant builds and reproducible execution.
- **Wake Tools** â€“ lightweight utilities, editors, and modules powered by Wake.
- **Community Packages** â€“ signed, reproducible `.wpkg` packages you can trust.

## ðŸŒŸ What makes Wake different?

- **Zero build time** â€“ code is compiled and run instantly.  
- **Reproducible builds** â€“ every package is signed and verifiable.  
- **Modular ecosystem** â€“ plug-and-play `.wpkg` packages.  
- **Local-first** â€“ runs directly on your machine, no cloud dependency.  
- **C99 core** â€“ minimal, portable, and blazing fast.
